2. In your terminal, enter ``npm install`` and ``npm run client-install`` to install the dependencies for both the server, and the client
3. ``cd`` into the server repository
4. Enter ``npm run dev`` in your terminal to start both the server and client simultaneously, or run the ``npm start`` command separately for both the server and client
5. Navigate to ``http://localhost:3000`` in your browser to view the client and interact with the server
